# Task 2: Date Extractor

# Problem Statement: Write a Python program that uses the datetime module to extract and display the current month and year. Additionally, allow the user to input a date string and parse it into a datetime object.
# Code Example:
# # main.py
# from datetime import datetime
# # Implement code to display the current month and year
# # Implement code to parse a user-input date string into a datetime object
# Expected Outcome: The program should accurately display the current month and year and successfully convert a user-input date string (e.g., "2023-03-15") into a datetime object, handling any invalid inputs gracefully.
